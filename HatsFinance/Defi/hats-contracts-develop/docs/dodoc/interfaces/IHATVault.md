# IHATVault

*Hats.finance*

> Interface for Hats.finance Vaults

A HATVault holds the funds for a specific project&#39;s bug bounties. Anyone can permissionlessly deposit into the HATVault using the vault’s native token. When a bug is submitted and approved, the bounty  is paid out using the funds in the vault. Bounties are paid out as a percentage of the vault. The percentage is set according to the severity of the bug. Vaults have regular safety periods (typically for an hour twice a day) which are time for the committee to make decisions. In addition to the roles defined in the HATVaultsRegistry, every HATVault  has the roles: Committee - The only address which can submit a claim for a bounty payout and set the maximum bounty. User - Anyone can deposit the vault&#39;s native token into the vault and  recieve shares for it. Shares represent the user&#39;s relative part in the vault, and when a bounty is paid out, users lose part of their deposits (based on percentage paid), but keep their share of the vault. Users also receive rewards for their deposits, which can be claimed at any  time. To withdraw previously deposited tokens, a user must first send a withdraw request, and the withdrawal will be made available after a pending period. Withdrawals are not permitted during safety periods or while there is an  active claim for a bounty payout. Bounties are payed out distributed between a few channels, and that  distribution is set upon creation (the hacker gets part in direct transfer, part in vested reward and part in vested HAT token, part gets rewarded to the committee, part gets swapped to HAT token and burned and/or sent to Hats governance). NOTE: Vaults should not use tokens which do not guarantee that the amount specified is the amount transferred This project is open-source and can be found at: https://github.com/hats-finance/hats-contracts



## Methods

### VERSION

```solidity
function VERSION() external view returns (string)
```

Returns the vault&#39;s version




#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | string | The vault&#39;s version |

### addRewardController

```solidity
function addRewardController(contract IRewardController _rewardController) external nonpayable
```

Adds a reward controller to the reward controllers list



#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _rewardController | contract IRewardController | The reward controller to add |

### allowance

```solidity
function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256)
```



*Returns the remaining number of tokens that `spender` will be allowed to spend on behalf of `owner` through {transferFrom}. This is zero by default. This value changes when {approve} or {transferFrom} are called.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| owner | address | undefined |
| spender | address | undefined |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |

### approve

```solidity
function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external nonpayable returns (bool)

*Sets `amount` as the allowance of `spender` over the caller&#39;s tokens. Returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded. IMPORTANT: Beware that changing an allowance with this method brings the risk that someone may use both the old and the new allowance by unfortunate transaction ordering. One possible solution to mitigate this race condition is to first reduce the spender&#39;s allowance to 0 and set the desired value afterwards: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729 Emits an {Approval} event.*
